## Personal

I'm Brazilian (mineiro â˜•ðŸ§€) and currently living in Denmark. I have around 7 years of experience as a Software Developer (or Engineer, if you prefer).

I actually graduated in Mechatronics Engineering but I started working with Web development right after my graduation. 
Moving forward some years I also worked on Data Engineering projects.
I've come to appreciate the idea of what people can do with a single computer and an Internet connection nowadays. We now have the potential to impact the lives of millions of people and the world itself from our home.

But I also find hardware really cool, and actually...most things related to tech and engineering. Besides, with AI becoming an increasing force in our lives, I'm now switching gears and going to another direction. 
I want to be closer to software, hardware and hot topics such as AI. Robotics seems like one way to tie all of this together, don't you think?
After all, this was my original intent when I decided to graduate in Mechatronics, to work with Robotics ðŸ˜‰. Today though, I see many possible ways of achieving this goal.

Therefore, this blog's content will reflect some of these things that I'm interested on and/or have experience with.
Welcome and I hope you enjoy reading my posts!

This is a live page and might be updated once in a while. You may also find some random topics (not tech or engineering related) in this blog. Surprise, surprise!
